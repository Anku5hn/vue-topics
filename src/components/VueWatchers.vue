<h1>Vue Watchers</h1>
<p>You can use watchers in vuejs when you need to respond with side effects on data changes. </p>
<p>For example, if the user wants to change their email. They input new value. Old value still needs to be stored. If the new value is invalid, the side effect would be to throw an error and continue with old value.</p>
