<h1>Vue Computed Properties</h1>
<p>Vue computed properties can help you conditionally view text inside elements in template which is controlled by conditions in a variable in script with <span style="color:lightblue;">computed(//code)</span> keyword.</p><br>
<p>An example of use of computed is when the total is needed in a shopping cart. You can use const total = computed(()=>{//return with reduce function},0);</p>
<p>The 0 is the initial value.</p>
